To demonstrate, we make use of the `Cora` dataset, which is a **citation network** where nodes represent documents.
Each node is described by a 1433-dimensional bag-of-words feature vector.
Two documents are connected if there exists a citation link between them.
The task is to infer the category of each document (7 in total).
